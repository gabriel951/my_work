# Info 
We are currently working in extending our formalisation of first-order AC-unification
to nominal AC-matching. This work was submitted to CICM and the extended version of
the paper is available here, see file `nominal_ac_matching_extended_version`. 

Before submitting to CICM, we also got valuable insight from presenting our work to 
researchers from King's College London (KCL) and University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The slides we presented in the 6th KCL-UIUC meeting are
available here too.
