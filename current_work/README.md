# Current Work 
I am currently working on formalising AC-unification in first-order. I have finished proving termination and soundness of the algorithm and I am currently working on proving completeness. 
Here you can find a paper (not published) about that, as well as the slides and videos of a presentation I made for a seminar at my university (UnB).
