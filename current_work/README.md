# Current Work 
I am currently working on formalising AC-unification in first-order. I have finished proving termination, soundness and completeness of the algorithm. 
Here you can find the paper we submitted to FSCD 2022 about that, as well as the slides and videos of two presentations: 

## Presentation 1
We had only soundness and termination at the time, and the
slides/presentation try to focus on motivating the lexicographic measure used in the
proof of termination   

## Presentation 2 
We have termination, soundness and completeness. The slides/presentation focus on how
we have sharpened the proof of completenes and removed a hypothesis.
