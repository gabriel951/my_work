# Goal 
This folder contains additional materials. Currently, it has a subfolder to
illustrate 
[structured proofs](https://medium.com/@gabrielferreirasilva/why-we-need-structured-proofs-in-mathematics-34a3034f2f90) 
and a list of articles I have read and found interesting (see below). 

# Interesting Reading
I have found the following links interesting:  
 - [Terry Tao on Career Advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)  
 - [On Proof and Progress In Mathematics](https://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/199/thurston.pdf)  
 - [Why Mathematicians Should Stop Naming Things After Each Other](http://nautil.us/issue/89/the-dark-side/why-mathematicians-should-stop-naming-things-after-each-other). This one is controversial.  
 - and of course, [How to Write a 21st Century Proof](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/proof.pdf)
