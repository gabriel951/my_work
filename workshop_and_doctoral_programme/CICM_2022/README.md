During the CICM 2022 Doctoral programme I had the opportunity to meet established
researchers from my area and present my research. I am grateful to have this
opportunity and want to thank everyone that gave suggestions. 

Special thanks to David Cerna, who kindly accepted being my mentor, gave
suggestions for my presentation and for the remaining part of my PhD and also gave me 
valuable career advice! :) 

In this folder you can find the pdf I submitted to CICM 2022 with my CV and my
research plans and the slides I presented during the doctoral programme.
