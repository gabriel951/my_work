# Info 
This folder contains our work on nominal AC-matching, which was accepted in CICM 2023. The extended version of
the paper is available here, see file `extended_version_nominal_ac_matching`. 

Before submitting to CICM, we also got valuable insight from presenting our work to 
researchers from King's College London (KCL) and University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The slides we presented in the 6th KCL-UIUC meeting are
available here too. After our submission to CICM 2023, [Mauricio Ayala-Rincón](https://www.mat.unb.br/ayala/) presented the research described 
in the paper as part of the  7th KCL-UIUC meeting. The slides we presented in the 7th
KCL-UIUC meeting are available here, and there is a [link to the video presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GjaGEsjrtyae3m9XoVx2V4djxkUZI7K6/view?usp=sharing). 

[Daniele Nantes](https://mat.unb.br/~dnantes/) presented our paper in the CICM 2023 conference. The slides are almost equal to the ones of the 7th KCL-UIUC meeting and we make them available here. 

PS: Thanks [Maribel Fernández](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/maribel-fernandez) for chairing the KCL-UIUC meetings and inviting us.
Thanks to Ayala for presenting the slides in the 7th meeting. :)
