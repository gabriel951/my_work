Unfortunately, we didn't wrote an extended version of this paper that I can make
available here. The paper can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/abs/formalising-nominal-cunification-generalised-with-protected-variables/0299ECF29C28FDD65AAE38E73BF28FE3).   

This paper started when Sandra Alves and Renata Wassermann invited the authors of the paper "A Formalisation
of Nominal C-Matching through Unification with Protected Variables" to submit an
extended version to a special issue of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science (MSCS). Therefore, I thank them for their invitation!
