# Info
In addition to the extended version of the  paper that we have submitted to FSCD 2022, this repository contains slides and video of some presentations that I gave 
for the group of "Theory of computation" at University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) about the content of the paper.   

## Presentation 1
We had only soundness and termination at the time, and the
slides/presentation try to focus on motivating the lexicographic measure used in the
proof of termination   

## Presentation 2 
We have termination, soundness and completeness. The slides/presentation focus on how
we have sharpened the proof of completenes and removed a hypothesis.
