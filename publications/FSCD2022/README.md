# Info
This directory contains the extended version of the paper that we have submitted to
FSCD 2022, along with the slides used in the presentation. In file
`questions_answers.md` we have some questions that were asked to Daniele Nantes (many thanks to her for
presenting our work!) and our answers. Finally, there are slides
and videos of two internal presentations that I gave for the group of "Theory of
computation" at University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) about the content of the paper.


## Presentation 1
We had only soundness and termination at the time, and the
slides/presentation try to focus on motivating the lexicographic measure used in the
proof of termination   

## Presentation 2 
We have termination, soundness and completeness. The slides/presentation focus on how
we have sharpened the proof of completenes and removed a hypothesis.
